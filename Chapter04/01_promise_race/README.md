# Promisify Wacky Races

Imagine we have a number of cars that are competing in the Wacky Races...

| Team | Car |
|------|-----|
| The Slag Brothers | The Boulder Mobile |
| Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth | The Buzzwagon |
| The Ant Hill Mob | The Bulletproof Bomb |
| The Gruesome Twosome | The Creepy Coupe |
| Penelope Pitstop | The Compact Pussycat |
| The Red Max | The Crimson Haybaler |
| Professor Pat Pending | The Convert-A-Car |
| Luke and Blubber Bear | The Arkansas Chuggabug |
| Peter Perfect | The Turbo Terrific |
| Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly | The Army Surplus Special |
| Dick Dastardly and Muttley | The Mean Machine |

We want to race them against each other by using our Promisify.race call

Using Promise.race(cars) and figure out who the winner is after 100 races are determined.

Simply line up all of the cars and let them go; it couldn't be any simpler than that!
